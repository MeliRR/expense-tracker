## Known Issues

- The app only sorts expenses in ascending order by amount. Future versions could include sorting by category or descending amount.
- There is no persistent storage for expenses. Once the page is refreshed, all data is lost. This could be improved by integrating localStorage or a backend database.
- The design is basic, and there is room for further improvements in terms of UI/UX.
